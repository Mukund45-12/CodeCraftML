# Advanced Machine Learning Methods for Chronic Kidney Disease Identification
**Abstract**—In today’s world medical diagnosing and proper treatment is a crucial part for everyone. Chronic kidney disease is a type of disease which can’t filter the blood as it does usual
and can lead to damage of kidneys if proper treatment is notapplied on time. The common reasons for Chronic Kidney Disease(CKD) are family history of kidney diseases or failure, high blood
pressure and types of diabetes. If this CKD reaches its worst condition it can cause kidney damage as well as lead to heart disease, bone diseases, anemia, high potassium and calcium etc.
We used the dataset taken from one of the hospitals of India over two months for classifying CKD using five different machine learning models: Random Forest, Logistic Regression, K-Nearest
Neighbors, Support Vector Machine & Kernel Naive Bayes. We used two types of precision metrics: Accuracy and F1 Score of each model and got that high accuracy and high F1-score in the K-Nearest Neighbors Model. Remaining machine learning models are also performed well almost 2 % less than the best one. Index Terms—Chronic Kidney Disease, Random Forest, Support Vector Machine, K-Nearest Neighbours, Kernel Naive-Bayes,
Logistic Regression.
